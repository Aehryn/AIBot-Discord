# AIBot-Discord

This bot is a Fork of the the bot "GPT-3.5-Chat-Bot" created by notunderctrl

The main difference is creating a /ping command and the ability for myself to upload it to Docker for Personal Usage.

This wasn't created to be used by other users, if you're interested in creating a similar bot "notunderctrl" created a excellent guide video.
